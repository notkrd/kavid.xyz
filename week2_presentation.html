<p>I feel like responding to the work in this way goes against the ide of Internet Art but I don&#39;t know if it goes against &quotPost-Internet Art&quot.
I don’t know if post-internet art actually exists unless it is maybe a fake intellectualism of internet art. 
I think we are stuck deep in the middle of the internet art age I do not think it is over at all.</p>

Vierkan\’s ideas don\’t take into consideration accessibility and censorship issues, especially outside of Western society.
</p>
<p>
Internet art is still internet art if it happens in meat space or incorporates elements from it.
</p>
<p>
It’s funny that &quot post-internet&quot art people are so uppitty about their art when internet art is in a lot of ways the antithesis of that.
</p>
<p>
<p>
They\’re trying to push internet art into this stuffy art critic art theory art history world and guess what it’s still internet art.
</p>
<p>
You could make an argument that there is a strong separation between &quot internet art&quot pre and post smartphone. So maybe it is post-internet art but only in an app art portable phone internet sort of way.

<p>There are several questions immediately present in discussing a &quot Post-Internet Art&quot - what the moment is we imagine to have passed, what the actual social / technical category of the internet is, and as to the intentions of / the potential tactics for artists working with rather than simply within it. I was born in 1995, the year the NSFNET was decommissioned and in which commercial traffic was allowed entry and dominance into the cables (copper, glass and plastic, or not cables but satellites) to eventually each of our bedrooms. Thus, I live with a certain regret that I was not intellectually and culturally present at that moment of my birth, when the internet was something a public discovered and imagined to be at stake. My practice’s history, as someone keen to write HTML fiction and web-servers that serve poetry at you, is also a history of practitioners imagining a utopian network while it was already something else, a military technology now strung between corporatized nodes.<p>

<p>I would argue that Net-Art also exists in a condition of spectrality, as a different practice in the protocol that could have allowed for some other structures of speech, community, and exchange: an obsession of much Net-Art, including Olia Lialina‘s and the Cameron’s World project, is the close relation between the affordances of the personal HTML webpage and the very particular iconography and popular visual culture that emerged to take advantage of those markup tags. The &quot Post-Internet&quot tag to a certain extent misstates the internet and it’s history. I would thus raise as a question the genealogy the Presenters offer from Dada -> Fluxus -> Net-Art -> Post Internet Art. As Borges imagines of Kafka, does net-art in fact create its predecessors, rather than the other way around?</p>

<p>The mythology of the internet has always been as much about its imagined future (minds free to frolic with the HAL-4000s in Cyberland) as about its history or present - I might suggest an alternate title &quot Pre-Post-Internet Art&quot ?  The 70s - 90s science fiction in the predictive or prophetic mode, the genre of fiction so beloved of the leading tech entrepreneurs, positions itself oppositely: because certain of its passages speak uncannily of the present’s novelties, futurology claims that The Internet could not have been (in essence) any other way. A first objection to the Post-X terminology is this suggestion of techno-determinism. Broan Docteur diagnoses well the way in which adapting to &quot postinternet &quot artistic production can risk buying into and reinforcing a corporate mythology of what the internet is, rather than productively engaging it.</p>
