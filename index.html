<h2>Autoblurb</h2> 

<p>I am an MFA student in Digital Arts and New Media at UC Santa Cruz, with an Sc.B. in Mathematics from Brown University and 
an A.B. in Literary Arts with Honors.</p>

<p>I am interested in structure, language, meaning and form - especially as they are investigated and reconÔ¨Ågured in 
interdisciplinary encounters. Especially essential to me are the practices of reading, writing, programming, and supporting 
others working artistically & across disciplines, towards necessary social re-imaginings. Research and/or teaching will 
hopefully continue to be part of this work.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in: digital language arts; abstract algebra and category theory; pataphysics and nonsense; 
games and interactive media; linguistics and poetry/fiction; and Bourbaki and the OuLiPo.</p>

<p><q>Then a miracle occurred in the form of a plate of sandwiches. Geryon took three and buried his mouth in a delicious 
block of white bread filled with tomatoes and butter and salt. He thought about how delicious it was, how he liked slippery 
foods, how slipperiness can be of different kinds. I am a philosopher of sandwiches, he decided. Things good on the 
inside.</q> <br>- Anne Carson</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://ornithological.kavid.xyz/">The Guide to Nonexistent Birds - an Ornithological Logic</a> <p>A generative fictional birdwatching guide, with an essay on taxonomy, formal logic, and the OuLiPo written in the comments to the Prolog code on the left. My first major digital writing project, some of the sentiments in the essay are a bit naive or immature, but it is also the project I feel most gleefully proud of.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://qfwfq.itch.io/lost-">Lost in the Asset Store</a><p>A digital space populated with free assets for the game engine Unity. Prefab logic, free assets, and free-to-copy code enter into the great majority both technical and digital artistic production, and this project means to explore, on their own terms, those digital commons.</p></li>
	<li> <p>Textileexittext: a computational embroidery project exploring metaphors and histories between text, textile, and computation. Used a corpus, Python NLP, and an embroidery machine to stitch generated text.</p> </li>
</ul>
