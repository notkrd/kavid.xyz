<!-- Sometimes i wonder what i am doing here, if coding is just gamified imperialism (logocentrism, grammatizing information-capitalism: pronouncing these pollysables suggests parody, in my partial understanding and partial confusion at them, but it is not really that), a game i'm drawn into now, distraction from dread etc. But how convenient it is when pleasure and potential pay align! And i do find the structure of it, variously colored and filling text editors, language making language, its puzzle and ultimate obedience, relentlessly aesthetic. Not that this is coding of course! Html a mere markup language - mark me not as an imposter, i've TAd a programming class! But what pleasure still, when i open the file in emacs, red & purple and blue, cursor blinking and progressing, numbers indicating something i can read, know the shortcuts to leap here or there, send it up on git, ssh, git pull, again. -->

<p>I am an MFA student in Digital Arts and New Media at UC Santa Cruz, with an Sc.B. in Mathematics from Brown University and an A.B. in Literary Arts with Honors.</p>

<p>I am interested in structure, language, meaning and form - especially as they are investigated and reconfigured in interdisciplinary encounters. Especially essential to me are the practices of reading, writing, programming, and supporting others working artistically & across disciplines, towards necessary social re-imaginings. Research and/or teaching will hopefully continue to be part of this work.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in: digital language arts; abstract algebra and category theory; pataphysics and nonsense; games and interactive media; linguistics and poetry/fiction; and Bourbaki and the OuLiPo.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio">Projects</h2>

<ul>	<li> <p><strong>Textileexittext</strong>: a computational embroidery project exploring metaphors and histories between text, textile, and computation. Used a corpus, Python NLP, mouse-and-keyboard macros, and an embroidery machine to stitch generated text.</p> 
		<img src="/static/images/textileexittext.jpg" alt="Image from Textileexittext installation at UCSC Open Studios, Fall 2017" width="288" height="216" /></li>
    	<li><p><a href="https://qfwfq.itch.io/lost-">Lost in the Asset Store</a> A digital space populated with free assets for the game engine Unity. Prefab logic, free assets, and free-to-copy code enter into the great majority both technical and digital artistic production, and this project means to explore, on their own terms, those digital commons.</p>
		<img src="/static/images/lost_in_assets.png" alt="Lost in the Asset Store screenshot" width="320" height="180" /></li>
    <li><p><a href="http://rooms.kavid.xyz">Room With Montague:</a> Early draft of a short story about my room / the murder of a semanticist, that I'm currently working on. A playable model of a toy Montague-grammar semantic model. Built in Scala Play.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href ="http://kavid.xyz/embed">embed+this=wherever</a> Early sketches towards the description: <q>embed+this=wherever is a computationally mediated diagram-poem cycle confronting the geometrization of language by neural networks and other algorithmic models, in search of the gaps around algorithm-fabricated spaces. The quirks and failures of such mathematical spaces, calculated from our collective language use in Wikipedia and similar tracts of the web, now surround, act upon, and watch us through systems for translation, sentiment and network surveillance, and the corporate characters for synthetic conversation - embed+this=wherever writes within these models hoping to reveal, interrupt, or alter, as well as use, them; their is nothing neutral about these geometries. It consists of short texts successively modified using GloVe word embeddings and the METAFONT algebraic typography system. In the draft sketch, the words in a sentence are diagrammed or constellated by their distance in the model, as words and character shapes change down lines of computed closeness</q>.</p></li>
	<li><p><a href="http://ornithological.kavid.xyz/">The Guide to Nonexistent Birds - an Ornithological Logic</a>[Currently down: we apologize profusely for the inconvenience] A generative fictional birdwatching guide, with an essay on taxonomy, formal logic, and the OuLiPo written in the comments to the Prolog code on the left. Uses Prolog logic programming to model the fictional space of the birding guide and for the HTTP server, if you're into that sort of thing. My first major digital writing project, there is much that is wrong with both its content and references, that i am thinking about how to address, including the sexual violence of Pablo Neruda, who epigraphs the piece (something deeply disturbing that i don't know whether it is possible to productively approach, erasure), but i will leave it here for now as i do think it offers something around the use of Oulipian constraint for digital literature. </p></li>
	<li><p><a href="/static/pdfs/TextAsThoughonMars.pdf"> As Though On Mars</a> Brown University honors thesis in digital language arts. A failed game and long short story about real fake astronauts. </p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/static/pdfs/KD-CalArtsPortfolio4.pdf">MFA Application Writing Portfolio</a> from two years ago, isn't any good but does show how i wrote and thought / think. Much i would like to change, but, i think i am now a writer or artist precisely in order to sit with and think with the things that i currently do not understand, in the art-as-research tradition. I want to see what other writers thought they did not understand, but now have an intuition and suspicion for the shape of, so i ought to not hide my first-and-incriminating experiments, in return. If you are up for it, please do read my first experiments, and tell me what you think about. </p></li>

  <li><p><a href="http://thefaraway.kavid.xyz">thefarawaysummerevenings, Genetically Wherever</a>[Currently down: we apologize profusely for the inconvenience] uses a genetic algorithm to direct a population of text towards phrases in a piece by John Ashbery's partially about the evolutionary process, "Whatever It Is, Wherever You Are" (i posted it here once). I've loved the Ashbery text for a long time; the mathematician Barry Mazur focuses on it in his small book that delighted me <q>Imagining numbers : (particularly the square root of minus fifteen).</q></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="http://kavid.xyz/OHELLOHIILIEHIDE.html">OHELLOHI ILIEHIDE Variations</a> response to the prompt to generate a booklet of text from a single 80x66 page of code</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://github.com/notkrd/doiwritemyself">do-i-write-myself</a> programs that write or write or write about themselves. Some follow the <= 255 character constraint. Currently one in Clojure and one in Racket</p></li>
