<h2>Autoblurb</h2> 
<p>I am an MFA student in Digital Arts and New Media at UC Santa Cruz, with an Sc.B. in Mathematics from 
Brown University and an A.B. in Literary Arts with Honors.</p>

<p>I am interested in structure, language, meaning and form - especially as they are investigated and reconÔ¨Ågured 
in interdisciplinary encounters. Especially essential to me are the practices of reading, writing, programming, 
and supporting others working artistically & across disciplines, towards necessary social re-imaginings. 
Research and/or teaching will hopefully continue to be part of this work.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in: digital language arts; abstract algebra and category theory; pataphysics and nonsense; games 
and interactive media; linguistics and poetry/fiction; and Bourbaki and the OuLiPo.</p>

<p><q>Then a miracle occurred in the form of a plate of sandwiches. Geryon took three and buried his mouth in a delicious block of 
white bread filled with tomatoes and butter and salt. He thought about how delicious it was, how he liked slippery foods, how 
slipperiness can be of different kinds. I am a philosopher of sandwiches, he decided. Things good on the inside.</q> <br>- Anne
